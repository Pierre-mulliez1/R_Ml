## Welcome to ML prediction in R 
# we will divide our project into 3 distinct parts 
- EDA via a shiny app
- Time series model 
- ML model 

We hope you find our findings exiting 

Good work habit for the team:
Separate the work in different branches for collaboration corresponding to each subpart of the project,
easier to merge changes if we work simultaneously
